Hi there! I am an undergraduate student at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yan Wang](https://sw.scu.edu.cn/info/1195/13570.htm). I am also a research intern at [Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute](https://sqz.ac.cn/), advised by [Prof. Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/index.html).

My research interests lie in the intersection of Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. Specifically, I am a fan of Video Understanding and Robotic Manipulation.
